# 🚀 Complete Deployment to Max's Vercel Account

## Step 1: Upload Files to GitHub (2 minutes)

**I just opened two things for you:**
1. ✅ GitHub upload page: https://github.com/Max777-em/elite-home-craft/upload/main
2. ✅ Your project folder with all files

### Upload These Files:
Drag these files from the folder to the GitHub page:
- ✅ index.html
- ✅ styles.css
- ✅ script.js
- ✅ package.json
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ vercel.json
- ✅ .gitignore

Then click **"Commit changes"**

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (1 minute)

Once files are uploaded to GitHub:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new?teamSlug=maxs-projects-61069016

2. Click **"Import Git Repository"**

3. You should see: **Max777-em/elite-home-craft**
   - If not, click "Import from GitHub" and search for it

4. Click **"Import"** on the elite-home-craft repository

5. Project settings:
   - Project Name: **elite-home-craft** (pre-filled)
   - Framework: **Other** or leave default
   - Root Directory: **./** (default)
   - Build Command: leave empty
   - Output Directory: leave empty

6. Click **"Deploy"**

7. Wait 30-60 seconds... ⏱️

8. **DONE!** 🎉

Your site will be live at:

## Alternative: Use Terminal (Faster)

If you prefer terminal, just run:
```bash
cd /Users/bella/elite-home-craft
./PUSH-TO-GITHUB.sh
```

Then follow the Vercel steps above.
